# Welcome to HASH ðŸ‘‹

This is HASH's default [community health repo](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file).

## What is this

This repo will contain default files for all HASH OSS repos and will be extended to include:

- Basic issue templates, covering Bug Reports and Feature Requests
- A PR template
- Our contributions guide: `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Our security terms: `SECURITY.md`
- Our code of conduct: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- Support information for our users in `SUPPORT.md`
- A base Renovate configuration that can be used and/or extended: `renovate-config.json`

### Why do this

The goal of this is to improve the onboarding experience for our open-source community members. For the timebeing we'll be working in public primarily out of the [`hash` monorepo](https://github.com/hashintel/hash) which already contains its own versions of the above (where applicable).
