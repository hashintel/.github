## HASH

**[HASH]** is a self-building knowledge graph and platform for high-trust data and AI.

### Underlying technology

HASH is made possible by combining a series of technologies:

- The **Semtype** standard for universal types that can be understood, used and composed by both people and machines
- The **hgres** high-performance knowledge graph engine written in Rust
- The **Petrinaut** framework for modeling distributed systems (and the world) using Petri nets
- The **[Block Protocol]** standard for composable user and AI-defined block-based interfaces and the applications that embed them
